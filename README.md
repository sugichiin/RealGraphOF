# RealGraphOF
## EVALUATION
  
In this section, We aimed to answer the following evaluation questions (EQs):  
 - EQ1[^eq1]: Does the idea of RealGraphOF improve the performance?  
 - EQ2[^eq1]: How much does RealGraphOF provide better performance than naive-RealGraphOF?  
 - EQ3[^eq3]: Does RealGraphOF outperform other single-machine-based graph engines equipped with NVMe-oF in a naive way?  
 - EQ4[^eq4]: Does RealGraphOF outperform other distributed-system-based graph engines?
